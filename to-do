    * Is it possible for this page to populate with different ideas depending on what is chosen, or do we need separate pages for each?

ActionPlan
    * Allow new lines to be displayed if they were a part of ActionEnter?
    * KYLE: Create mailto: link so you can email the plan to yourself.
    * Make it so you have the option to add your action to your calendar.
    * KYLE: Make it possible to remove items from plan.
    * KYLE: Make page show up as in a new screen instead of always showing (thinking mobile-friendly)

General
    * Add back button to all pages except Welcome.
    * For each page, center everything on the screen (but keep left-align text)
