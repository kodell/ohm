Welcome
    * ROCHELLE: Create Welcome page and include "Make a plan" button/link to start process.

ListChoose
    *

ActionEnter
    * Add padding inside of the text box so the text isn't right against the edge.
    * Use x icon from x.svg file to cancel out date.

GetIdeas
    * Is it possible for this page to populate with different ideas depending on what is chosen, or do we need separate pages for each?

ActionPlan

    * ROCHELLE: Add "Add More" button that sends you back to ListChoose page.
    * ROCHELLE: Create mailto: link so you can email the plan to yourself.
    * Make it so you have the option to add your action to your calendar.
    * Make it possible to remove items from plan.
    * Make page show up as in a new screen instead of always showing (thinking mobile-friendly)
